# Command line interface

:::info
The CLI is still in development and doesn't provide any functionality yet.
:::

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, make sure you have npm installed as well and everything added to path

## Installation

Use ` $ npm i -g @confly-dev/confly` to install the CLI globally.
Now you can call ` $ confly <command>` from anywhere you want.

OR you can use the CLI without any installation and just use `npx @confly-dev/conf
